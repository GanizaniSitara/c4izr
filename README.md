- Modularized conversion logic with enhanced logging and error reporting.
- Supports custom mapping configurations for C4 properties.
- Auto-backup and versioning of output files.
- Comprehensive test suites to validate conversion functionality.

## Upcoming Features

- Web-based preview mode for interactive conversion.
- Uses LLMs to convert bitmap images to draw in C4 format.
- Additional enhancements based on user feedback.

1. Pass a single file or directory as an argument.
2. Follow the interactive prompts or use non-interactive mode via command-line options.
3. Adjust scaling, logging, and output settings using provided CLI options.
